# CHALLENGE NODE JS

This is the solution I came up with for the node.js challenge of CÃ³digo del Sur.
It's an API that allows user registration , login, fetch a list with popular movies provided by https://www.themoviedb.org/
save user's favorite movies and retrieve them.

I used sqlite3 for the DB and objection.js as the ORM.

The server listens on port 8080.

For the movies related endpoints, a token must be provided, it is implemented as a Jason Web Token and needs to be included in the Authorization header
using the Bearer schema, for example :  Headers  {Authorization: Bearer <<token>> }.

# Endpoints

## User related

### POST | /user/sign-in  - Parameters (email,firstName,lastName,password)
Allows the user to sign-in , in the request body you must provide email, firstName , lastName (can be empty), and password.
It has simple input validation.

Request example:
{
    "email": "123@prueba.com",
    "firstName": "Prueba",
    "lastName": "", 
    "password": "********"
}

The response looks like this:
{
    "message": "User created succesfully",
    "newUser": "123@prueba.com"
}


### POST | /user/login - Parameters (email,password)
The request body must have email and password, here's an example:
{
    "email": "123@prueba.com",
    "password": "*******"
}


The response looks like this:

{
    "message": "Login succesful",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6IjEyM0BwcnVlYmEuY29tIiwidXNlcklkIjo1LCJpYXQiOjE2NDE0ODc4ODYsImV4cCI6MTY0MTQ5MTQ4Nn0.JFvzQgnX6ph1RhtWJ9bUy-QpktvPyhQoAM9AfzdQ1Uo"
}

The token must be included in all the Movie related requests.
